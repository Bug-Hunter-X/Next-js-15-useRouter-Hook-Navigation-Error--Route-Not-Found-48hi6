# Next.js 15 useRouter Hook Navigation Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `useRouter` hook in Next.js 15 for client-side navigation. The error occurs when attempting to navigate to a route that doesn't exist or contains a typo.

## Problem

The `useRouter.push()` method throws an error if the target route is invalid.  This error can be challenging to debug because the error message from Next.js may not clearly indicate the cause, especially in larger applications.

## Solution

The solution is to ensure that the route you're navigating to exists and is correctly spelled.  Implement comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage such situations.  Consider logging the error or displaying a user-friendly message.  This example provides a basic implementation to prevent the app from crashing and provides better feedback to the user.
